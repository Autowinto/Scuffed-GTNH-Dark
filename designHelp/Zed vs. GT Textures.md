# Zed vs New GT Textures
## New Textures / Unskinned
./
- armorgui3x3
- armorgui3x4
	- Might look good with green instead of blue
- BrickedBlastFurnace
- DataAccess2by2 and DataAccess4by4
	- can be replaced with 2by2.png/4by4.png maybe add circuit backgrounds
- FakeAssemblyLine
- GuiButtons
	- Maybe use already existing button textures from ./Template in Zed
- GuiCover
- Implosion
- Inventory Manager
- Item Distributor
- Magic Absorber
- OutputHatch
- RedstoneCircuitBlock
- Retriever
- SolarHPBoiler
	- Recolour of SolarBoiler
- Sonictron
- Teleporter
- Tradeomat_Main
- Tradeomat_Settings
- Volumetric Flask

./Basic Machines
- Assembler2
	- Just add more slots to existing Assembler texture
- Autoclave2
	- Just add a second output for dusts
- Autoclave3
	- Two additional outputs for dust
- Autoclave 4
	- Three additional outputs for dust
- Circuit Assembler
- Cutter2
	- Additional slot for circuit next to input
- DistillationTower
- FusionReactor
- Miner
	- Maybe a pickaxe for status progress
- Mixer2
	- 9 inputs
- Mixer4
	- 6 inputs, 4 outputs
- Mixer6
	- 9 inputs, 4 outputs
- NineXNine
- OilCracker

./multimachines
- General: Screws could be used to fill space, multiblock specific colour scheme maybe
- Advanced_Miner2
	- Give it a screen like ElectricBlastFurnace
- AssemblyLine
	- Give it a screen like ElectricBlastFurnace
- DistillationTower
	- Give it a screen like ElectricBlastFurnace
- DrillingRig
	- Give it a screen like ElectricBlastFurnace
- FusionComputer
	- Same texture as other FustionComputer
- LargeChemicalReactor
	- Give screen
- LargeDieselEngine
- LargeExtremeDieselEngine
- LargeHeatExchanger
- LargeTurbine
- OilcrackingUnit
- OreDrillingPlant
- ProcessingArray
- PyrolyseOven
- VacuumFreezer

## Textures which need rework
./
- BronzeBlastFurnace
	- Three instead of two input and output slots
- ChestBuffer
	- Ugly ass arrow
	- Additional icon
- Regulator
	- Additional charge spot next to power
- SuperBuffer
	- Additional Button
	- Bigger input for orb if we wanna be artsy

./Basic Machines
- Assembler
	- should have 6 inputs instead of 2
- Autoclave
	- Two inputs instead of 1 (left dust, right circuit)
	- Additional fluid output
- ChemicalBath
	- Second middle .. output?
- ChemicalReactor
	- Second output
	- Why does the arrow have just two feet?
	- Original texture has interesting shadows in input slots
- Distillery
	- Has an item output slot now?
- Fermenter
	- Has an item output slot now?
- Massfabricator
	- Has an item output slot now?
	- OwO Matter to UwU Matter
- Mixer
	- Has 6 instead of 2 inputs
- PotionBrewer
	- Has an item output slot now?

./multimachines

## Remarks
- General:
	- Some machines can configure a circuit by clicking on the GT-Logo
		- Give the GT logo a circuit shadow maybe
./
- ComputerCubeRedstone
	- No rounded corners
- Filter, TypeFilter
	- Icon 3 and 4 not really clear
- FustionComputer
	- No rounded corners
	- Might benefit from a computer screen like panel

./Basic Machines
- Aplifabricator
	- Since uwu-matter is a meme, add a reference to the fluid output
- BronzeAlloySmelter
	- Move screw all the way to left middle
- ElectromagneticSeparator
	- Magnet could be red/blue
- Polarizer
	- Magnet could be red/blue
- Replicator
	- UWU-Matter
- SteelAlloySmelter
	- Move the fucking screw


./multimachines
- ImlosionCompressor
	- Screws should be rearranged
- MultiFurnace
	- Screws should be rearranged
