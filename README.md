# Scuffed-GTNH-Dark
GT New Horizons: Dark theme for 2.1.2.4

./designHelp/Gregtech.lang needs to be moved to the root of the modpack. It colors the gui-text appropriately.

## Texturing progress
| Mod                     | Number of textures | Progress |

## Known issues
- Beacon UI seems to have graphical bugs even on vanilla texture (probably an Optifine issue)
