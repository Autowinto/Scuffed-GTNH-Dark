# Scuffed-GTNH-Dark
GT New Horizons: Dark theme for 2.1.2.0

./designHelp/Gregtech.lang needs to be moved to the root of the modpack. It colors the gui-text appropriately.

## Texturing progress
| Mod            | Number of textures | Progress |
|----------------|--------------------|----------|
| Minecraft      | 22/22              | 100%      |
| NotEnoughItems | 5/5                | 100%     |
| Gregtech       | 43/145             | 29%      |

## Known issues
- Beacon UI seems to have graphical bugs even on vanilla texture (probably an Optifine issue)
